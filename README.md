### stretch goals:
-  Make it a 2 player game.
-  Assign a color to each player.
-  Make bet options randomize when playing a new game.
-  Add an extra color which would be worth 5 points but there would only be one on the board.

# DESCRIPTION
For this projoect I wanted to include the subjects we have covered so far the course and and incorporated them in building the game. It's my first time ever coding, therfore, I've tried something that was manageable for my level and used some recources to help me accomplish this task. They will later be mentioned . I named this project LUCK!
Luck is a guessing game. In the game a player gets to select one of the three bet options, red, blue or purple, then select  a tile on the board where they think it might be hidden and click on the BET button to place their bet. Underneath all the black and white pieces random red, blue and purple are hidden. The player gets points for guessing the right color. there are 15 random red and blue hidden, each worth one point. By guessing it correctly the player gets a point. If not, the player loses a point. there is only one hidden purple it is worth five points, just like the other ones if the player matches the color they receive five points. Otherwise, OOF! 
The game is won when the player has a score of 8 points or more.

# ARCHITECTURE
To structure my project, I have reviewed the codes we've covered in class especially as a reference for my functions, I have also used developers web sites as sources to solve some probloms as well as YouTube tutarials. And of course Claude Ai.
The sources I've used are:
