Luck Description
Luck is a game where a player will be placing bets and hope that the choices they make turn to their advantage. 
Overall, the player will have a board where on top of the board there will be white and black colors.
Underneath those colors will be random colors of blue and red. 
When placing a bet the player will have the option to select the color they want to bet on,  
which will be randomly placed underneath the black and white colors. 
Players will  first select the bet options (red or bleu) on the side of the board then select any of the black and white colors on the board,
which will then flip and display the color underneath it.
If the player has guessed correctly there will be a score section keeping  track of the points they’ve accumulated. 
If the player gets the right answer they will be rewarded a point, 
if they get the wrong color they will have a point deducted from them.
There will be 16 squares on the board, if they score  8 or more they win the game. 
if the player’s final score if less than 8 they will lose the game.
